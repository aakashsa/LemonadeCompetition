** Requirements: Matlab

** To run the code: >> make
   or in the matlab console window type:
                    >> scores = lemonadeCompetition( 7,'yourAndrewID')

If you change the name of the folder 'yourAndrewID', you should also change
the second argument of the function lemonadeCompetition in the previous 
command. If you want to run the competition for more rounds, change the first
argument of the function (currently it is set to 7). You must also populate
the files 'adversary1.txt' and 'adversary2.txt' to have as many lines as the
number of rounds (see below).



** Description of files:
===============================================================================
Files you may want to change:
===============================================================================
- makefile: You might want to change the number of rounds (first argument of
            the function lemonadeCompetition).
- adversary1.txt: The file must have as many lines as the number of rounds
            that you specify in the makefile. Each line has one integer per 
            line, and it corresponds to the position that your first 
            adversary chose at the corresponding round.
- adversary2.txt: Similar to adversary1.txt.
- yourAndrewID/HW5/LEMONADE: You should put the program files for your agent
            in this folder.
- PickMyLemonadeSpot.sh: You should change the contents of this file, so that
            it executes your program. The output of the latter should be the
            file position.txt with only one integer in the first line (the
            position of your stand at the following round).
- previous.txt: See the description of the programming exercise of HW5.
===============================================================================
===============================================================================
Files you may don't need to change:
===============================================================================
- lemonadeCompetition.m: runs the competition between you and the adversaries.
- compute_scores.m: Given 3 positions around the island, it computes the points
             earned by you and your two adversaries.
